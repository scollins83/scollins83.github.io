This codebase was made in order to improve the code in the [Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program so it could
run as a command-line application rather than as a Jupyter notebook, with unit testing.  
  
By doing this, I was able to do a comparison of this particular language translation model to a more fully featured model. 
I chose [AWSLabs' Sockeye](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye) model as the more fully featured translator model for this comparison, as I was also learning about 
how MxNet compared with TensorFlow and Keras at the time.  
  
My original Language Translation project iPython Notebook from the Udacity course is here: [iPython Notebook](https://github.com/scollins83/deep-learning/blob/work_files/language-translation/dlnd_language_translation_SEC.ipynb)
